# TagTrace

**TagTrace** is a modern lost-and-found recovery platform that makes it easy for people to return lost items securely and anonymously. It works by attaching unique tags (QR codes or NFC) to valuables, which link to an online profile where finders can report a lost item and contact the rightful owner — without accessing their personal details.

## 🧠 Idea Summary

- Attach a **TagTrace** code (QR/NFC) to your valuables.
- If the item is lost, anyone who finds it can scan the tag.
- The finder is redirected to a web interface where they can report the found item.
- The owner gets notified and can arrange a safe, anonymous return — with optional rewards.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Unique tag generation (QR code / NFC-compatible).
- 🔒 Privacy-first — no personal info revealed to finders.
- 📬 Instant notification to item owners when tags are scanned.
- 💬 Secure in-platform messaging for communication.
- 🎁 Optional reward system to encourage good samaritans.
- 🧾 Dashboard to manage tags, status of items, and messages.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Register** an account.
2. **Create a tag**: generate a unique QR/NFC tag linked to your item.
3. **Attach** the tag to your item.
4. If lost and found, the finder scans the tag, submits a return request.
5. You get notified instantly and can chat with the finder safely.
